## Not All Customers Are Created Equal

Have you ever wondered who your most valuable customers are? This project, created for a software company, aims to discover what makes their users unique and how to identify those who stand out above the rest.

## Updates

#### Current Progress

* Testing models to predict revenue generated by customer
* Experimented with creating 2-5 customer clusters

#### Next Steps

* Create formal data cleaning pipeline
* Engineer more features in order to reduce errors
* Try different feature selection techniques

## Project Outline

#### Data Sources
